@article{Decker2008a,
abstract = {Service oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style for building software systems based on services. Especially in those scenarios where services implement business processes, complex conversations between the services occur. Service choreographies are a means to capture all interaction obligations and constraints from a global perspective. This article introduces choreographies as an important artifact for SOA, compares them to service orchestrations and surveys existing languages for modeling them.},

@techreport{Baryannis2008,
abstract = {This deliverable presents a survey on the state-of-the-art in service composition. The report is structured into three main sections. First, different models and languages for service composition are described. These involve service orchestration, choreography, wiring, coordination, and semantic WS composition. The next part evaluates approaches to creation and development of service compositions, including model-driven, automated, and QoS-aware service composition. Finally, formal methods to verification of service compositions are presented. Each section starts with an introduction and classification of the approaches and then describes the main contributions in the corresponding area.},

@inproceedings{Mancioppi2010,
abstract = {Quality attributes of software products like maintainability and reliability have been widely studied in the Software Engineering literature. Their understanding has proven instrumental for developing best practices and tooling support that ultimately result in higher-quality software. In this paper we investigate external quality attributes (i.e. aspects of quality visible to the end user) of service choreographies. Service chore- ographies are service compositions that specify completely distributed, message-based interactions among services. Our work is a first step to- wards the definition of a quality model for service choreographies.},
