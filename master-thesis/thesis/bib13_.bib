	abstract = "Web service coordination and composition have become a central topic for the development of Internet-based distributed computing. A wide variety of different standards have been defined to deal with the composition of Web services (usually represented as workflows) and the execution of coordination protocols. On the other hand, some relevant research proposals have already pointed to the use of the same formalism for both aspects, being Petri nets one of the adopted formalisms. In this work we present a case study showing how the adoption of the Nets-within-Nets paradigm helps in the modelling of complex coordination protocols and workflows. We first propose a Petri net model for a Web service peer able to run any workflow and to dynamically interpret the coordination required protocols. The execution of these protocols allows the peer to integrate functionalities offered by external peers. The Linda communication model has been used to support the integration among peers.",

The next part evaluates approaches to creation and development of service compositions, including model-driven, automated, and QoS-aware service composition. Finally, formal methods to verification of service compositions are presented. Each section starts with an introduction and classification of the approaches and then describes the main contributions in the corresponding area.",

Especially in those scenarios where services implement business processes, complex conversations between the services occur.

The Web services choreography description language (WS-CDL) is a Web service specification developed by W3C, in order to provide peer-to-peer collaborations for participants from different parties. Despite the great research interests it has received during recent years, no practical or even prototype execution engine has been built for WS-CDL, which is, however, essential to test and evaluate the properties of WS-CDL when doing research on it, and promote its application fields in business. This paper implements an execution engine of WS-CDL, which has never been built before, and experiments on the functionalities and performance of the engine. We also address the extensions toward WS-CDL, namely WS- CDL+, which are built into our execution engine. Finally, the whole paper is concluded, addressing the application perspectives of WS-CDL/WS-CDL+.",

	abstract = "A choreography describes the interaction between services. It may be used for specification purposes, for instance serving as a contract in the design of an interorganizational business process. Typically, not all describable interactions make sense which motivates the study of the realizability problem for a given choreography. In this paper, we show that realizability can be traced back to the problem of controllability which askes whether a service has compatible partner processes. This way of thinking makes algorithms for controlla- bility available for reasoning about realizability. In addition, it suggests alternative definitions for realizability. We discuss several proposals for defining realizability which differ in the degree of coverage of the specified interaction.",

@InProceedings{ Peng2009,
	abstract = "Nowadays, the mainstream of Web 2.0 website services is in the REST style called RESTful web service. RESTful services have been widely accepted by the public because of the usability and simplicity. Meanwhile, web service technologies realize service-oriented architecture (SOA) successfully and are exploited in both industry and academia. Notably, service composition that can aggregate existing services into a new one delivers the most benefits of SOA through BPEL standard. However, BPEL cannot support RESTful services and integrate both Web 2.0 and SOA-based resources in a composite service directly. It means that it is costly or time-consuming to utilize RESTful services in an SOA-based application. Therefore, this paper presents a framework, namely REST2SOAP, to integrate SOAP services and RESTful services. REST2SOAP leverages WADL specification, and can wrap RESTful services into SOAP services semi-automatically. Using REST2SOAP, developers can create a BPEL service that combines SOAP, RESTful services and user interfaces simultaneously.",

It is expected that not only the participating services are complex and have observable states, but the number of interacting services may be also large. Prior work on choreographies (conversation protocols) all focuses on specifying how the interacting web services should behave globally. Studies have shown that the relationships between global and local specifications of service interactions could be rather intricate. In this paper, we formulate a framework consisting of logical and implementation levels. We survey and discuss the technical problems and known results concerning service design, analysis and verification in this framework.",
